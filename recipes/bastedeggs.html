            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.</p>
    
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
       
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low.
            </p>
             <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.            </p>
